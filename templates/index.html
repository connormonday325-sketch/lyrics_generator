[Intro]
Yeah yeah...
Oh baby ohhh...

[Verse 1]
I dey think about you every night,
Your love dey make my heart feel light,
Even when the world dey stress me,
Na your smile dey bless me.

I no fit lie, you be my peace,
Anytime you talk my worries cease,
If love na crime, make dem arrest me,
Cause I no go ever forget me.

[Chorus]
Oh my love, you be my vibe,
You dey make my soul come alive,
When you hold me, I no go hide,
Baby girl, na you be my pride.

Oh my love, you be my song,
Even for the night you shine strong,
No matter the pain, I go stay long,
Cause your love dey keep me strong.

[Verse 2]
City lights but my mind on you,
Every road I walk na because of you,
Dem say love no easy but I dey try,
For your matter baby I fit fly.

I go hustle, I go grind for you,
Make I build a better life for you,
If you fall, I go catch you fast,
This our love go forever last.

[Bridge]
Baby dance with me slow slow,
Make the whole world know know,
Say na you I choose for life,
Na you be my future wife.

[Outro]

Love na you be my blessing...

[Intro]
Yeah...
Listen...

[Verse 1]
I been fighting demons, I been chasing dreams,
Life ain't what it seems, everything in extremes,
I remember nights when the pain was loud,
Now I'm standing tall, I ain't bowing down.

They doubted my hustle, they doubted my grind,
But I kept my focus, I kept my mind,
${topic} on my chest like a heavy chain,
But I turn that struggle into power and gain.

[Hook]
I rise, I fall, I stand again,
Through the scars, through the rain,
No fear in my veins, no weakness inside,
I'm built for the storm, I'm ready to ride.

[Verse 2]
I got goals bigger than the hate they bring,
I'm chasing crowns, yeah I'm chasing kings,
If I lose today, I win tomorrow,
I turn my pain into less sorrow.

I'm writing my story, no skipping the page,
I'm breaking these walls, I'm breaking this cage,
${topic} in my heart but I stay so strong,
Cause my destiny been waiting too long.

[Outro]
Yeah...
We keep going...

[Intro]
Ayy...
Listen up...

[Verse 1]
Late nights, cold streets, heart on freeze,
Enemies watching, they move like thieves,
${topic} in my mind, it don't let me sleep,
But I'm still on grind, gotta stack that heap.

No love for the fake, no trust for the weak,
Talk too much, now you lookin' cheap,
I been through pain, I been through fire,
Now I’m built like steel, I aim much higher.

[Hook]
Step in the dark, still shine bright,
If I want it, I'ma take that life,
No fear, no tears, just pure fight,
I survive the storm every single night.

[Verse 2]
They don't know the struggle, they don't know the pain,
They don't know my story, they just see the fame,
I move with my bros, we don't play no games,
${topic} made me cold, made me change my name.

I remember days when the food was low,
Now I’m on top and my vision glow,
If you betray, then you gotta go,
Cause in my world we move like snow.

[Outro]
Ayy...
We move...

[Verse 1]
Baby when you call my name,
It feels like fire, it feels like flame,
I’ve been searching for a love so true,
Now I found it all in you.

[Chorus]
${topic} got me feeling weak,
Got me dreaming while I'm still awake,
I don't wanna lose this feeling now,
Cause your love is all I need somehow.

[Verse 2]
Hold me close and don’t let go,
I want this love to always grow,
No matter the pain, no matter the fight,
I'll be yours every day and night.

When the storm was rising high,
You were there, You heard my cry,
You gave me strength, You gave me peace,
In Your love my fears release.

[Chorus]
Lord I lift my hands to You,
For ${topic} You pulled me through,
Every battle You have won,
In Your light I see the sun.

[Verse 2]
Even when the road was long,
You gave my heart a brand new song,
Now I stand, I testify,
You are God, You are my life.

Hallelujah...
